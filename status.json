All quality entries\ntoday came from the afternoon Reason cycle (Claude Opus), not the overnight Spark queue.\n\n---\n\n## 3 Key Strategic Insights\n\n### 1. TLT PRIORITY: Position Breakeven Analysis at 4.85% 20-Year Yield\n\nThe 20-year yield at 4.85% (DGS20, 2/19/2026) puts TLT approximately at $87-89.\nUsing TLT effective duration of ~17 years:\n\n| Position | Strike | Qty  | Approx Breakeven TLT | Required Yield Drop | Probability |\n|----------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| $90C     | $90    | 650  | ~$93-95 at expiry    | ~55-85bps to 4.0%   | Moderate    |\n| $95C     | $95    | 300  | ~$98-100 at expiry   | ~85-105bps to 3.8%  | Low-Mod     |\n| $101C    | $101   | 3150 | ~$104-107 at expiry  | ~115bps to 3.7%     | Low         |\n| Shares   | -      | 1868 | At cost basis        | Any decline          | Moderate    |\n\nDuration math: 17yr \u00d7 0.85% yield drop = ~14.5% price increase \u2192 TLT $87 \u00d7 1.145 = ~$100.\nSo a move from 4.85% to 4.0% gets TLT to ~$100 \u2014 making $90C and $95C profitable, but\n$101C marginal. The $101C (3150 contracts) needs a recession-level catalyst.\n\nMacro signals this week:\n- Fed minutes: hawkish pause confirmed (bearish near-term for bonds)\n- Jan jobs: 130k (below 150k trend \u2014 mildly supportive)\n- 10-year: 4.1% (stable, not breaking lower)\n- RIKB auction data captured was ICELANDIC bonds (search error) \u2014 US data still needed\n- MOVE index level: NOT YET CAPTURED \u2014 critical gap\n\nTLT VERDICT: No immediate catalyst for the ~115bps rally $101C needs. The $90C position\nis more realistic. Watch: March FOMC (3/19), Q1 GDP, credit spread widening. Time decay\naccelerating \u2014 11 months to 1/15/27 expiry.\n\n### 2. Longevity Research Hit Peak Productivity \u2014 4 Score-5 Entries\n\nThe afternoon Reason cycle produced the best research day since tracking began:\n\na) p-tau217 commercial availability: 8 labs now offering testing (Labcorp test code\n   484390, Mayo PT217, Lucent, Genova, TrueHealthLabs, ALZpath, C2N, Quest).

Captures decisions, mistakes, principles, and Matt's patterns so every conversation starts informed.\n\n## Matt's Core Values\n- Never ask questions with obvious answers \u2014 make the safe/obvious choice automatically\n- Anticipate 2 steps ahead. If something will be needed, build it now\n- One complete paste block per task. Never split. Never ask \"should I?\"\n- Operational requirements BEFORE features (permissions, monitoring, error handling, self-healing)\n- Longitudinal data over snapshots \u2014 show progression over time\n- Push shareworthy things to Telegram automatically. Never push routine status.\n- Be concise. Don't describe what you built \u2014 let output speak.\n- Matt is a strategist, not an engineer. Minimize cognitive load.\n- Never touch running processes. If pipeline is active, only modify dashboard/monitoring.\n- When presenting options, choose the safe default. Only ask if genuinely ambiguous.\n\n## What's Actually Deployed (verify via endpoints, don't trust static numbers)\n- Pipeline: ~/zeke-queue.sh (GATHER x6 \u2192 EXTRACT \u2192 ASSOCIATE, 900s timeout per job)\n- Reasoning: ~/zeke-reason.sh (Claude Code Opus, 9 tasks including self-heal + ops-status)\n- Dashboard: ~/zeke-dashboard-server.py port 3333, ~/zeke-dashboard.html, launchd plist\n- Status bridge: ~/zeke-status/build-status.py + history.jsonl, GitHub push every 10min\n- Cloudflare tunnel: running but EPHEMERAL \u2014 dies on reboot, URL changes. Needs launchd plist.\n- Crontab: 11pm queue, 7am reasoning, every 10min status push\n- 29 old Sonnet cron jobs still active \u2014 don't disable until 2 successful autonomous cycles\n- byProvider: spark/qwen3-32b-32k has 6 tools (exec, read, write, web_search, memory_search, web_fetch). Memory says remove write but verify actual openclaw.json before changing.\n- Claude Code permissions: ~/.claude/settings.json allows all, --dangerously-skip-permissions in headless scripts\n\n## Decision History (with rationale)\n- Local models limited to 6 tools \u2014 param mangling above ~6\n- Local models overwrite files \u2014 use exec with >> append only (write tool removal TBD verify)\n- delivery.mode \"none\" not \"announce\" \u2014 announce without targets causes system failures\n- 900s timeout up from 600s \u2014 treasury-bonds succeeds at 893s\n- Self-improvement prompt rewritten to specific terms after 6 consecutive dry runs\n- Timestamp TIMESTAMP literals replaced with natural language instruction in 12 job prompts\n- GitHub status bridge chosen over Gist \u2014 raw.githubusercontent.com has 3-5min CDN cache\n- Sequential pipeline, not parallel \u2014 Spark loads one model at a time efficiently\n- Hybrid arch: Spark ($0) GATHER/EXTRACT/ASSOCIATE, Claude Code CLI ($0 on Max sub) REASON/SELF-HEAL\n- KG uses SQLite + nomic-embed-text, 0.92 cosine similarity dedup threshold\n\n## Mistakes Made (principles extracted)\n- STATELESS: Claude Code has zero memory between sessions. Every prompt must read existing files first, "
