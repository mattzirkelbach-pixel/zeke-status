All quality entries\ntoday came from the afternoon Reason cycle (Claude Opus), not the overnight Spark queue.\n\n---\n\n## 3 Key Strategic Insights\n\n### 1. TLT PRIORITY: Position Breakeven Analysis at 4.85% 20-Year Yield\n\nThe 20-year yield at 4.85% (DGS20, 2/19/2026) puts TLT approximately at $87-89.\nUsing TLT effective duration of ~17 years:\n\n| Position | Strike | Qty  | Approx Breakeven TLT | Required Yield Drop | Probability |\n|----------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| $90C     | $90    | 650  | ~$93-95 at expiry    | ~55-85bps to 4.0%   | Moderate    |\n| $95C     | $95    | 300  | ~$98-100 at expiry   | ~85-105bps to 3.8%  | Low-Mod     |\n| $101C    | $101   | 3150 | ~$104-107 at expiry  | ~115bps to 3.7%     | Low         |\n| Shares   | -      | 1868 | At cost basis        | Any decline          | Moderate    |\n\nDuration math: 17yr \u00d7 0.85% yield drop = ~14.5% price increase \u2192 TLT $87 \u00d7 1.145 = ~$100.\nSo a move from 4.85% to 4.0% gets TLT to ~$100 \u2014 making $90C and $95C profitable, but\n$101C marginal. The $101C (3150 contracts) needs a recession-level catalyst.\n\nMacro signals this week:\n- Fed minutes: hawkish pause confirmed (bearish near-term for bonds)\n- Jan jobs: 130k (below 150k trend \u2014 mildly supportive)\n- 10-year: 4.1% (stable, not breaking lower)\n- RIKB auction data captured was ICELANDIC bonds (search error) \u2014 US data still needed\n- MOVE index level: NOT YET CAPTURED \u2014 critical gap\n\nTLT VERDICT: No immediate catalyst for the ~115bps rally $101C needs. The $90C position\nis more realistic. Watch: March FOMC (3/19), Q1 GDP, credit spread widening. Time decay\naccelerating \u2014 11 months to 1/15/27 expiry.\n\n### 2. Longevity Research Hit Peak Productivity \u2014 4 Score-5 Entries\n\nThe afternoon Reason cycle produced the best research day since tracking began:\n\na) p-tau217 commercial availability: 8 labs now offering testing (Labcorp test code\n   484390, Mayo PT217, Lucent, Genova, TrueHealthLabs, ALZpath, C2N, Quest). Cost\n   $195-$400. FDA cleared Lumipulse G pTau217/AB42 ratio May 2025. Insurance coverage\n   expanding. ACTIONABLE: Matt should consider testing given 3-4 year prediction window.\n\nb) AKL003 Phase 1b: Launched 2/19/2026 (2 days ago), actively recruiting ages 25-75.\n   Alpha Klotho mRNA in LNPs, IV administration, 2:1 randomization, single site at GARM\n   Clinic in Prospera, Roatan, Honduras.

Human safety/efficacy data is the gap to fill. Source: pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n2. **AI agent reliability** \u2014 Tool-calling accuracy is the limiting factor for\n   Zeke autonomy. Monitor Berkeley BFCL leaderboard for model improvements.\n   Current ceiling: ~88% multi-step. Gap: real-world reliability below benchmark.\n\n## Tier 2 \u2014 Periodic Check (Weekly)\n3. **Spaced repetition implementation** \u2014 Apply double-spacing intervals to Zeke\n   feed review. Research is settled; priority shifts to implementation.\n4. **Treasury yields** \u2014 10Y at 3.95%, Fed holding. Monitor for rate cut signals\n   that affect TLT position.\n\n## Tier 3 \u2014 Diminishing Returns (Reduce Feed Weight)\n5. **tool-calling general** \u2014 Saturated. Consolidate to monthly summary.\n6. **compound-synthesis** \u2014 Derivable locally; not worth dedicated feed slots.\n7. **AI agent benchmarks (general)** \u2014 High noise/signal ratio; filter to\n   specific named tools only (Claude Code, Lovable, Cursor).\n\n## Feed Health Notes\n- Dedup pass needed: tool-calling topic has 8+ near-identical entries this cycle\n- compound-synthesis entries should be generated locally, not ingested as feed\n- Quality scoring working well; 4-5 scores are surfacing genuinely useful content\n",
