All quality entries\ntoday came from the afternoon Reason cycle (Claude Opus), not the overnight Spark queue.\n\n---\n\n## 3 Key Strategic Insights\n\n### 1. TLT PRIORITY: Position Breakeven Analysis at 4.85% 20-Year Yield\n\nThe 20-year yield at 4.85% (DGS20, 2/19/2026) puts TLT approximately at $87-89.\nUsing TLT effective duration of ~17 years:\n\n| Position | Strike | Qty  | Approx Breakeven TLT | Required Yield Drop | Probability |\n|----------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| $90C     | $90    | 650  | ~$93-95 at expiry    | ~55-85bps to 4.0%   | Moderate    |\n| $95C     | $95    | 300  | ~$98-100 at expiry   | ~85-105bps to 3.8%  | Low-Mod     |\n| $101C    | $101   | 3150 | ~$104-107 at expiry  | ~115bps to 3.7%     | Low         |\n| Shares   | -      | 1868 | At cost basis        | Any decline          | Moderate    |\n\nDuration math: 17yr \u00d7 0.85% yield drop = ~14.5% price increase \u2192 TLT $87 \u00d7 1.145 = ~$100.\nSo a move from 4.85% to 4.0% gets TLT to ~$100 \u2014 making $90C and $95C profitable, but\n$101C marginal. The $101C (3150 contracts) needs a recession-level catalyst.\n\nMacro signals this week:\n- Fed minutes: hawkish pause confirmed (bearish near-term for bonds)\n- Jan jobs: 130k (below 150k trend \u2014 mildly supportive)\n- 10-year: 4.1% (stable, not breaking lower)\n- RIKB auction data captured was ICELANDIC bonds (search error) \u2014 US data still needed\n- MOVE index level: NOT YET CAPTURED \u2014 critical gap\n\nTLT VERDICT: No immediate catalyst for the ~115bps rally $101C needs. The $90C position\nis more realistic. Watch: March FOMC (3/19), Q1 GDP, credit spread widening. Time decay\naccelerating \u2014 11 months to 1/15/27 expiry.\n\n### 2. Longevity Research Hit Peak Productivity \u2014 4 Score-5 Entries\n\nThe afternoon Reason cycle produced the best research day since tracking began:\n\na) p-tau217 commercial availability: 8 labs now offering testing (Labcorp test code\n   484390, Mayo PT217, Lucent, Genova, TrueHealthLabs, ALZpath, C2N, Quest). Cost\n   $195-$400. FDA cleared Lumipulse G pTau217/AB42 ratio May 2025. Insurance coverage\n   expanding. ACTIONABLE: Matt should consider testing given 3-4 year prediction window.\n\nb) AKL003 Phase 1b: Launched 2/19/2026 (2 days ago), actively recruiting ages 25-75.\n   Alpha Klotho mRNA in LNPs, IV administration, 2:1 randomization, single site at GARM\n   Clinic in Prospera, Roatan, Honduras.

Captures decisions, mistakes, principles, and Matt's patterns so every conversation starts informed. READ THIS FIRST before any session. Update it before ending any session that makes structural changes.\n\n---\n\n## Matt's Core Values\n- Never ask questions with obvious answers \u2014 make the safe/obvious choice automatically\n- Anticipate 2 steps ahead. If something will be needed, build it now\n- Operational requirements BEFORE features (permissions, monitoring, error handling, self-healing)\n- Longitudinal data over snapshots \u2014 show progression over time\n- Be concise. Don't describe what you built \u2014 let output speak\n- Matt is a strategist, not an engineer. Minimize cognitive load\n- Never touch running processes. If pipeline is active, only modify dashboard/monitoring\n- When presenting options, choose the safe default. Only ask if genuinely ambiguous\n- **Assessment before action**: state what you confirmed about a file/component before modifying or deprecating it.
