All quality entries\ntoday came from the afternoon Reason cycle (Claude Opus), not the overnight Spark queue.\n\n---\n\n## 3 Key Strategic Insights\n\n### 1. TLT PRIORITY: Position Breakeven Analysis at 4.85% 20-Year Yield\n\nThe 20-year yield at 4.85% (DGS20, 2/19/2026) puts TLT approximately at $87-89.\nUsing TLT effective duration of ~17 years:\n\n| Position | Strike | Qty  | Approx Breakeven TLT | Required Yield Drop | Probability |\n|----------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| $90C     | $90    | 650  | ~$93-95 at expiry    | ~55-85bps to 4.0%   | Moderate    |\n| $95C     | $95    | 300  | ~$98-100 at expiry   | ~85-105bps to 3.8%  | Low-Mod     |\n| $101C    | $101   | 3150 | ~$104-107 at expiry  | ~115bps to 3.7%     | Low         |\n| Shares   | -      | 1868 | At cost basis        | Any decline          | Moderate    |\n\nDuration math: 17yr \u00d7 0.85% yield drop = ~14.5% price increase \u2192 TLT $87 \u00d7 1.145 = ~$100.\nSo a move from 4.85% to 4.0% gets TLT to ~$100 \u2014 making $90C and $95C profitable, but\n$101C marginal. The $101C (3150 contracts) needs a recession-level catalyst.\n\nMacro signals this week:\n- Fed minutes: hawkish pause confirmed (bearish near-term for bonds)\n- Jan jobs: 130k (below 150k trend \u2014 mildly supportive)\n- 10-year: 4.1% (stable, not breaking lower)\n- RIKB auction data captured was ICELANDIC bonds (search error) \u2014 US data still needed\n- MOVE index level: NOT YET CAPTURED \u2014 critical gap\n\nTLT VERDICT: No immediate catalyst for the ~115bps rally $101C needs. The $90C position\nis more realistic. Watch: March FOMC (3/19), Q1 GDP, credit spread widening. Time decay\naccelerating \u2014 11 months to 1/15/27 expiry.\n\n### 2. Longevity Research Hit Peak Productivity \u2014 4 Score-5 Entries\n\nThe afternoon Reason cycle produced the best research day since tracking began:\n\na) p-tau217 commercial availability: 8 labs now offering testing (Labcorp test code\n   484390, Mayo PT217, Lucent, Genova, TrueHealthLabs, ALZpath, C2N, Quest).
