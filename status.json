Markets are not driven by technical patterns alone \\u2013 broader forces like economic cycles, policy decisions, and recurring seasonal demand can create predictable tailwinds or headwinds for assets. By analyzing multi-timeframe trends (from month-to-month seasonality up to yearly or decadal macro cycles) alongside technical signals, traders can gauge the \\u201cbig picture\\u201d context behind price action. The goal is to identify confluence \\u2013 for example, when a bullish technical setup aligns with a favorable macro cycle (e.g. an easing interest rate environment) and a strong seasonal period, the probability of success may increase. This concept is central to a Macro Cycle Confluence Score system, which assigns a score based on how many of these factors are aligned. In this guidebook section, we explain the major macro and seasonal cycle drivers for four key assets \\u2013 Bitcoin (BTC), Gold, Crude Oil (USOIL), and S&P 500 (SPX) \\u2013 and how traders can integrate these insights into a confluence scoring approach for multi-timeframe analysis.\\n\\nEach asset\\u2019s section will cover: key macroeconomic factors and seasonal patterns, their historical impact on price cycles (with multi-month, annual, and long-term examples), and practical tips for traders on incorporating these inputs into a Macro Cycle Confluence Score or similar framework.

Traders analyzing SPX must consider factors that affect corporate profits and investor risk appetite on multiple timeframes:\\n\\nEconomic Growth & Corporate Earnings Cycle: The stock market is forward-looking, often rising during economic expansions when corporate earnings are growing, and faltering when a recession looms (earnings decline). The business cycle (expansion -> peak -> recession -> trough -> expansion) is a cornerstone of equity pricing. During the early and mid-expansion phases, stocks tend to do well as revenues and profits climb. In late-cycle expansions, if growth overheats or inflation picks up, stocks can become choppier, anticipating a downturn. Once a recession hits, stocks usually enter a bear market (a decline >20%), often bottoming before the recession officially ends in anticipation of recovery. For instance, in the 2008\\u20132009 Global Financial Crisis, SPX peaked in late 2007 when the economy was still seemingly fine, then plunged throughout 2008 as the recession unfolded, bottoming in March 2009 even though the recession didn\\u2019t end until later that year. The subsequent expansion (2009-2019) saw a long bull market. Similarly, the 2020 COVID recession caused one of the fastest bear market drops (SPX fell ~34% in a month) followed by a steep recovery as stimulus and reopening drove a new expansion. Traders should watch economic indicators (GDP, unemployment, PMIs, consumer spending) as well as corporate earnings reports and guidance. If earnings are in an upswing (companies beating expectations, raising forecasts), that\\u2019s bullish for stocks. If earnings are contracting or many warnings are issued, it\\u2019s bearish. In a confluence score, one could incorporate an earnings trend factor (e.g. positive earnings revisions breadth = +1, negative revisions = \\u20131). Often, the stock market tops out about 6\\u20139 months before earnings peak and bottoms ~6 months before earnings trough \\u2013 this is the earnings cycle lead-lag. Recognizing those inflection points is key.\\nInterest Rates and Fed Policy: Monetary policy is a critical macro driver for SPX. Low interest rates reduce borrowing costs, boost corporate profits, and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds (the TINA \\u2013 \\u201cThere Is No Alternative\\u201d \\u2013 effect when yields are near zero). High rates do the opposite: they increase costs, can choke off growth, and provide competition for stocks (investors can get yield elsewhere). Thus, the Fed\\u2019s rate hike and cut cycles have a big impact. Historically, stock valuations (P/E ratios) tend to expand when rates are falling or low, and contract when rates are rising (particularly if inflation is high) . It\\u2019s often said \\u201cDon\\u2019t fight the Fed\\u201d \\u2013 when the Fed is easing, stocks have a tailwind; when \", \"domain\": \"trading\", \"tags\": [\"camel-finance\", \"cycle-trading\", \"web-content\"], \"quality_hint\": \"high\"}",

TLT PRIORITY: Position Breakeven Analysis at 4.85% 20-Year Yield\n\nThe 20-year yield at 4.85% (DGS20, 2/19/2026) puts TLT approximately at $87-89.\nUsing TLT effective duration of ~17 years:\n\n| Position | Strike | Qty  | Approx Breakeven TLT | Required Yield Drop | Probability |\n|----------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| $90C     | $90    | 650  | ~$93-95 at expiry    | ~55-85bps to 4.0%   | Moderate    |\n| $95C     | $95    | 300  | ~$98-100 at expiry   | ~85-105bps to 3.8%  | Low-Mod     |\n| $101C    | $101   | 3150 | ~$104-107 at expiry  | ~115bps to 3.7%     | Low         |\n| Shares   | -      | 1868 | At cost basis        | Any decline          | Moderate    |\n\nDuration math: 17yr \u00d7 0.85% yield drop = ~14.5% price increase \u2192 TLT $87 \u00d7 1.145 = ~$100.\nSo a move from 4.85% to 4.0% gets TLT to ~$100 \u2014 making $90C and $95C profitable, but\n$101C marginal. The $101C (3150 contracts) needs a recession-level catalyst.\n\nMacro signals this week:\n- Fed minutes: hawkish pause confirmed (bearish near-term for bonds)\n- Jan jobs: 130k (below 150k trend \u2014 mildly supportive)\n- 10-year: 4.1% (stable, not breaking lower)\n- RIKB auction data captured was ICELANDIC bonds (search error) \u2014 US data still needed\n- MOVE index level: NOT YET CAPTURED \u2014 critical gap\n\nTLT VERDICT: No immediate catalyst for the ~115bps rally $101C needs. The $90C position\nis more realistic. Watch: March FOMC (3/19), Q1 GDP, credit spread widening. Time decay\naccelerating \u2014 11 months to 1/15/27 expiry.\n\n### 2.

If something will be needed, build it now\n- One complete paste block per task. Never split. Never ask \"should I?\"\n- Operational requirements BEFORE features (permissions, monitoring, error handling, self-healing)\n- Longitudinal data over snapshots \u2014 show progression over time\n- Push shareworthy things to Telegram automatically. Never push routine status.\n- Be concise. Don't describe what you built \u2014 let output speak.\n- Matt is a strategist, not an engineer. Minimize cognitive load.\n- Never touch running processes. If pipeline is active, only modify dashboard/monitoring.\n- When presenting options, choose the safe default. Only ask if genuinely ambiguous.\n\n## What's Actually Deployed (verify via endpoints, don't trust static numbers)\n- Pipeline: ~/zeke-queue.sh (GATHER x6 \u2192 EXTRACT \u2192 ASSOCIATE, 900s timeout per job)\n- Reasoning: ~/zeke-reason.sh (Claude Code Opus, 9 tasks including self-heal + ops-status)\n- Dashboard: ~/zeke-dashboard-server.py port 3333, ~/zeke-dashboard.html, launchd plist\n- Status bridge: ~/zeke-status/build-status.py + history.jsonl, GitHub push every 10min\n- Cloudflare tunnel: running but EPHEMERAL \u2014 dies on reboot, URL changes. Needs launchd plist.\n- Crontab: 11pm queue, 7am reasoning, every 10min status push\n- 29 old Sonnet cron jobs still active \u2014 don't disable until 2 successful autonomous cycles\n- byProvider: spark/qwen3-32b-32k has 6 tools (exec, read, write, web_search, memory_search, web_fetch). Memory says remove write but verify actual openclaw.json before changing.\n- Claude Code permissions: ~/.claude/settings.json allows all, --dangerously-skip-permissions in headless scripts\n\n## Decision History (with rationale)\n- Local models limited to 6 tools \u2014 param mangling above ~6\n- Local models overwrite files \u2014 use exec with >> append only (write tool removal TBD verify)\n- delivery.mode \"none\" not \"announce\" \u2014 announce without targets causes system failures\n- 900s timeout up from 600s \u2014 treasury-bonds succeeds at 893s\n- Self-improvement prompt rewritten to specific terms after 6 consecutive dry runs\n- Timestamp TIMESTAMP literals replaced with natural language instruction in 12 job prompts\n- GitHub status bridge chosen over Gist \u2014 raw.githubusercontent.com has 3-5min CDN cache\n- Sequential pipeline, not parallel \u2014 Spark loads one model at a time efficiently\n- Hybrid arch: Spark ($0) GATHER/EXTRACT/ASSOCIATE, Claude Code CLI ($0 on Max sub) REASON/SELF-HEAL\n- KG uses SQLite + nomic-embed-text, 0.92 cosine similarity dedup threshold\n\n## Mistakes Made (principles extracted)\n- STATELESS: Claude Code has zero memory between sessions. Every prompt must read existing files first, "
