All quality entries\ntoday came from the afternoon Reason cycle (Claude Opus), not the overnight Spark queue.\n\n---\n\n## 3 Key Strategic Insights\n\n### 1. TLT PRIORITY: Position Breakeven Analysis at 4.85% 20-Year Yield\n\nThe 20-year yield at 4.85% (DGS20, 2/19/2026) puts TLT approximately at $87-89.\nUsing TLT effective duration of ~17 years:\n\n| Position | Strike | Qty  | Approx Breakeven TLT | Required Yield Drop | Probability |\n|----------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| $90C     | $90    | 650  | ~$93-95 at expiry    | ~55-85bps to 4.0%   | Moderate    |\n| $95C     | $95    | 300  | ~$98-100 at expiry   | ~85-105bps to 3.8%  | Low-Mod     |\n| $101C    | $101   | 3150 | ~$104-107 at expiry  | ~115bps to 3.7%     | Low         |\n| Shares   | -      | 1868 | At cost basis        | Any decline          | Moderate    |\n\nDuration math: 17yr \u00d7 0.85% yield drop = ~14.5% price increase \u2192 TLT $87 \u00d7 1.145 = ~$100.\nSo a move from 4.85% to 4.0% gets TLT to ~$100 \u2014 making $90C and $95C profitable, but\n$101C marginal. The $101C (3150 contracts) needs a recession-level catalyst.\n\nMacro signals this week:\n- Fed minutes: hawkish pause confirmed (bearish near-term for bonds)\n- Jan jobs: 130k (below 150k trend \u2014 mildly supportive)\n- 10-year: 4.1% (stable, not breaking lower)\n- RIKB auction data captured was ICELANDIC bonds (search error) \u2014 US data still needed\n- MOVE index level: NOT YET CAPTURED \u2014 critical gap\n\nTLT VERDICT: No immediate catalyst for the ~115bps rally $101C needs. The $90C position\nis more realistic. Watch: March FOMC (3/19), Q1 GDP, credit spread widening. Time decay\naccelerating \u2014 11 months to 1/15/27 expiry.\n\n### 2.

The gateway's internal timeout (600000ms) is shorter than the queue script's `--timeout 900000`, so the gateway kills sessions before the queue timeout fires\n- Action taken: NOT restarting gateway (it is currently functional for this Reason session)\n- Recommendation: Add 120s startup delay or health-check loop to zeke-queue.sh before first job\n\n### Issue 2: self-improvement domain \u2014 8+ consecutive \"No new developments\" (BROKEN)\n- Symptom: Feed lines 178-182 all contain `\"insights\":[\"No new developments\"]`\n- Root cause: Search query \"self-improvement developments\" returns popscience listicles\n- Action taken: Domain flagged as RETIRED in research-priorities.md\n- Prompt rewrite DRAFTED but NOT applied to jobs.json (deferred to avoid breaking cron)\n- Proposed new search terms:\n  - \"deliberate practice randomized controlled trial 2025 2026 site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"\n  - \"spaced repetition human trial effect size 2025 2026\"\n  - \"working memory training meta-analysis 2026\"\n  - \"cognitive enhancement protocol peer-reviewed quantified outcomes\"\n- Proposed domain rename: \"self-improvement\" to \"cognitive-science\"\n\n### Issue 3: Literal shell variable timestamps in 5 entries (BUG)\n- Symptom: Feed lines 176, 177, 183, 191, 192, 193 have `$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)` as literal text\n- Root cause: Agent wraps entire echo string in single quotes, preventing shell expansion\n- Action taken: Documented. Fix requires updating ALL job prompt",

Retired self-improvement domain (8+ consecutive dry runs)\n4. Drafted 5 prompt fixes (all deferred to manual review)\n5. Updated research-priorities.md with answered question tracking\n6. Updated daily-synthesis with TLT breakeven analysis\n7. Updated meta-learning with Opus vs Spark quality gap data\n\n### Recommendations (Priority Order)\n1. FIX: Add health-check loop to zeke-queue.sh before first job\n2. FIX: Investigate/increase gateway internal timeout to match script timeout\n3. APPLY: Self-improvement prompt rewrite to jobs.json\n4. APPLY: Fix timestamp generation in all job prompts (use variable, not inline)\n5. APPLY: Add \"US Treasury\" qualifier to treasury-bonds prompt\n6. MONITOR: Next queue run for gateway stability\n",
