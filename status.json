TradingView\\u2019s Bar Replay feature lets you do exactly that \\u2013 replay historical price action as if it were unfolding live. This is excellent for practicing your swing trading eye and testing strategies on past data.\\n\\nWhat is Bar Replay? Bar Replay allows you to simulate past market movements bar by bar. You choose a point in history, and then hit play \\u2013 the chart will advance candle by candle at the speed you set . It\\u2019s like watching the market in a time machine. You won\\u2019t see future bars beyond your chosen point, so you can try identifying setups and making decisions, then see what the next candles bring.\\n\\nHow to Use Replay: First, note that Bar Replay is a paid feature (available on Pro/Plus/Premium plans) \\u2013 free users won\\u2019t see the replay button. If you\\u2019re on a trial or subscription, you\\u2019ll find the Replay button on the top toolbar (it looks like a play icon \\u25b6\\ufe0f). To start a replay:\\n\\nClick the Bar Replay button. A red vertical line with a scissor icon will appear on your chart, along with a replay control bar.\\nClick on the chart at the date/time where you want to start replaying from . For example, you could click on a point last year right before a big move.\\nOnce you select the point, the chart will jump to that moment in time (hiding everything to its right). Now use the controls: Play to auto-play candles, Forward to step one bar at a time, and a speed selector to adjust playback speed .\\nWatch the candles form as they did historically. You can pause anytime to analyze or draw on the chart (yes, you can use drawing tools during replay).\\nIf you want to jump to another time, use \\u201cGo to\\u2026\\u201d on the replay bar and click a new start point .\\n\\nMulti-Timeframe Replay: A powerful aspect \\u2013 if you have multiple charts in a layout (premium feature), you can sync replay across all of them . For instance, replay both a daily and hourly chart together to see how they interact. In the replay control, you can choose to replay on one chart or all charts in the layout . \\u201cAll charts\\u201d mode will align the starting point across timeframes, so you can monitor, say, the weekly and daily simultaneously as history unfolds \\u2013 great for cycle analysis.\\n\\nPractice Makes Perfect: Use replay to test your strategy. For example, you can pretend you\\u2019re trading in mid-2022: draw your trendlines and support, see if you\\u2019d have bought the dip, then hit play to see if it works out. It trains your pattern recognition without the bias of knowing the outcome. Perhaps you spot a head-and-shoulders pattern, place where you would short, and see if the market indeed falls afterwards.\\n\\nLimitations: Keep in mind, not everything works in replay. Real-time elements like live news won\\u2019t show, and certain derived data (like some custom indicators) might behave differently without future data. Also, replay is bounded by how much historical data is available for that symbol/timeframe (e.g., you might not replay v\", \"domain\": \"trading\", \"tags\": [\"camel-finance\", \"cycle-trading\", \"web-content\"], \"quality_hint\": \"high\"}",

Camel draws trendlines to connect these key points and to visually track the cycle\\u2019s progression. There are two primary types of trendlines used:\\n\\n\\u2022 Downtrend lines \\u2013 drawn across descending swing highs during a declining phase. Breaking above a downtrend line often signals that a cycle low has formed and a new upswing is beginning.\\n\\n\\u2022 Uptrend lines \\u2013 drawn under ascending swing lows during a rising phase. Breaking below an uptrend line can signal that a cycle peak (top) has formed or even that a cycle is failing.\\n\\nUsing Trendline Breakouts as Confirmation: Camel treats a trendline breakout as a critical confirmation signal. For example, when price trades and closes above a downtrend line, it confirms that the prior downtrend is over and a new cycle upswing is likely underway. This breakout serves as a green light to consider long entries, since it indicates a cycle bottom has been left behind. Conversely, if price falls and closes below an uptrend line that has supported the cycle\\u2019s rise, it warns that the cycle\\u2019s top may be in place or imminent, suggesting it\\u2019s time to tighten stops or take profit. By waiting for a candle close beyond the trendline (not just an intraday poke through it), false signals are reduced.\\n\\nCamel\\u2019s strategy emphasizes combining trendline breaks with cycle timing. A trendline break that occurs around the expected timing for a cycle low or high is especially meaningful. For instance, if a daily cycle low is due and the price punches through a downtrend line, these two clues together strongly indicate the cycle low is confirmed. This alignment boosts confidence in taking a trade. Similarly, if an uptrend line breaks earlier than expected (an \\u201cearly\\u201d top), it could mean a left-translated cycle (bearish scenario) is unfolding. In all cases, trendlines help Camel quickly validate what the cycle model is suggesting.\\n\\nAvoiding Premature Entries: By relying on trendline confirmations (often alongside other signals like swing lows or moving average crosses), Camel avoids entering trades too early. A trendline breakout is tangible evidence of shifting momentum. This way, he sidesteps the risk of jumping in while a cycle is still headed down or getting out while a cycle still has room to run. Waiting for that clear break means a slightly later entry or exit, but with a higher probability of success. In summary, trendlines act as a safety check \\u2014 ensuring a new cycle has truly begun or ended before fully committing to a position.\", \"domain\": \"trading\", \"tags\": [\"camel-finance\", \"cycle-trading\", \"web-content\"], \"quality_hint\": \"high\"}",

In this scenario, global markets experienced a sharp, sudden sell-off triggered by investors unwinding massive yen-funded trades. This abrupt drop in prices initially made it appear as though an important cycle had topped and perhaps even failed (since the decline was so severe). Many traders feared that the bull trend was over.\\n\\nWhat Actually Happened: Despite the panic, Camel\\u2019s analysis confirmed that the cycle did NOT fail. While the sell-off was steep, price never definitively closed below the prior cycle\\u2019s low on the timeframe being tracked. In other words, the essential criterion for a cycle failure (a lower low beneath the previous cycle trough) was not met.\\n\\nThe trendline drawn under the cycle\\u2019s rising lows was briefly breached intraday, but it did not see a sustained breakdown on a closing basis. Shortly after, the market stabilized and reversed back up, indicating the cycle\\u2019s top was not real. The sharp drop turned out to be a false breakdown or shake-out rather than a true cycle termination.\\n\\nCamel\\u2019s trendline strategy allowed him and his followers to recognize that this was a temporary dislocation. The quick recovery back above the uptrend line and into the prior range was a strong signal that the cycle uptrend remained intact. This realization opened the door for re-entry into long positions at attractive prices once the dust settled.\\n\\nTraders who had exited during the scare could confidently get back in when the market regained its footing, thanks to the trendline confirming the continuity of the cycle. The Yen carry trade unwind case reinforced an important lesson: stick to the defined signals and avoid emotional decisions.\\n\\nEven amid unusual macro-driven volatility, the technical criteria (in this case, holding the cycle low and reclaiming the trendline) kept Camel on the right side of the market. By removing any implication that the cycle had failed, the guidebook underscores that one off event did not invalidate the broader trend.\\n\\nKey Takeaway: A violent market move can test your trendlines and resolve, but if the market does not actually break the previous cycle low or maintain a breakdown, then the cycle is still in play. Traders should remain nimble \\u2013 step aside during the shock if needed, but be ready to re-enter once price action confirms the cycle\\u2019s resilience. Camel\\u2019s approach in the Yen carry trade unwind exemplified trust in the technical signals over knee-jerk reactions.\", \"domain\": \"trading\", \"tags\": [\"camel-finance\", \"cycle-trading\", \"web-content\"], \"quality_hint\": \"high\"}",

Camel prefers to use regular linear scale charts for virtually all of his technical analysis. On a linear scale, equal vertical distances represent equal price changes (e.g. a move from 10 to 20 appears the same size as 50 to 60).\\n\\nThis straightforward scaling keeps trendlines and price patterns easy to interpret without adjustment. Camel finds that linear charts best reflect the actual price momentum and are more intuitive for setting levels and spotting breaks.\\n\\nBy contrast, logarithmic (log) scale charts space the vertical axis in percentage terms (so a move from 10 to 20, which is +100%, will occupy the same vertical space as 50 to 100, also +100%). Log scales are occasionally used for assets that have undergone enormous percentage changes \\u2013 a common example is long-term cryptocurrency charts or very long-range stock charts \\u2013 where price has increased or decreased by orders of magnitude.\\n\\nIn those special cases, log charts can make parabolic moves and long-term trendlines more visually manageable. Camel generally does not use log charts for his day-to-day trading, but he acknowledges there are niche situations (e.g. looking at Bitcoin\\u2019s entire 10-year history) where a log scale might be applied.\\n\\nImpact on Trendlines: If you do switch between linear and log scales, be aware that your trendlines will often need redrawing. A trendline that is perfectly touching key highs on a linear chart may not line up on a log chart, and vice versa, because the scaling of price is different. For example, a straight line on linear scale becomes a curved line on a log scale chart (and thus is no longer a valid \\u201cline\\u201d connecting the same points).\\n\\nTherefore, it\\u2019s important to choose one scale and draw trendlines on that scale for consistency. Since Camel sticks to linear scaling, all trendlines in his strategy are drawn and evaluated on linear charts. If a trader opts to use log scale for a particular analysis, they should redraw the trendlines on the log view to ensure accuracy of break points.\\n\\nIn summary, use linear scale by default for Camel\\u2019s strategy (simpler and preferred), and only consider log scale in rare cases \\u2013 always redrawing trendlines after such a switch to maintain valid reference lines.\", \"domain\": \"trading\", \"tags\": [\"camel-finance\", \"cycle-trading\", \"web-content\"], \"quality_hint\": \"high\"}",

These ensure consistency and improve the reliability of trendline signals. When adding trendlines to your charts, consider the following guidelines:\\n\\n\\u2022 Use Wicks Over Closes: When drawing trendlines, connect the wick highs and lows (the extreme points of the candlesticks) rather than just the candle bodies or closing prices. By using the wicks, you capture the true extremes of price movement. Camel prefers wick-to-wick trendlines because they account for all intraday volatility, ensuring no significant price spike is ignored. This often means your line might cut through some candle bodies, but it will touch the furthest excursion of price.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udccc Note on Trendline Methodology\\n\\nTraditional methods and the CMT curriculum often recommend drawing trendlines using the bodies of candles. However, Camel has found greater accuracy and trade precision using wicks instead. This variation reflects personal preference and real-world effectiveness over textbook theory.\\n\\n\\u2022 Minimum Two Touches: Ensure a trendline has at least two clear touchpoints before considering it valid. In practice, the first two points establish the line, and the third touch (or more) confirms its significance. A line drawn through only one point isn\\u2019t a trendline at all, and a line with just two points is still unproven until price interacts with it again. The more times price respects a trendline (touching it and bouncing off, or just undershooting/overshooting minimally), the more trust Camel places in that line.\\n\\n\\u2022 Preference for Shallower Slope: Recognize that steep trendlines are more likely to fail quickly. A very steep line (nearly vertical) indicates a sharp, aggressive move; while exciting, such moves often don\\u2019t sustain and their trendlines tend to break on the slightest pullback. In contrast, shallower trendlines (those angled more gently) tend to be stronger and more reliable. A gradual uptrend line, for example, implies a steady trend that can persist and is not overextended. Breakouts from shallower trendlines also have a higher probability of follow-through. In short, be cautious with steep lines; don\\u2019t be surprised if they break, and don\\u2019t bet the farm on them holding for long.\", \"domain\": \"trading\", \"tags\": [\"camel-finance\", \"cycle-trading\", \"web-content\"], \"quality_hint\": \"high\"}",

Low interest rates and abundant liquidity have historically fueled crypto rallies (e.g. the 2020\\u20132021 bull run amid global easy money), whereas tightening financial conditions can pressure Bitcoin as investors rotate away from risk. For instance, when macro fear spikes or stocks sell off, Bitcoin has often fallen alongside equities . It is not entirely an uncorrelated safe haven \\u2013 in fact, its 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has at times exceeded 0.7 (70%), indicating a strong link to equity market sentiment . Traders should monitor central bank policies (like Fed rate hikes/cuts) and overall risk-on vs. risk-off mood, as these set the backdrop for BTC\\u2019s cycle. Generally, looser monetary policy (rate cuts, QE) tends to create a positive macro cycle for Bitcoin by driving investment into higher-yielding or speculative assets. However the primary thesis of bitcoin is that it becomes a flight to safety and de-couples from equities, however this is still yet to be proven. It has shown recent strength (April-May 2025), and held up against a major SPX and NDQ selloffs and is starting to perform more and more like gold but this will be a long road and has barely started.\\nInflation & \\u201cDigital Gold\\u201d Narrative: Bitcoin is sometimes dubbed \\u201cdigital gold\\u201d and has been viewed by some investors as an inflation hedge. Notably, one analysis found Bitcoin had a high positive correlation with CPI inflation over the past decade . In periods of rising inflation or currency debasement fears, Bitcoin has attracted flows as an alternative store of value (e.g. during 2020\\u2019s stimulus surge, some sought BTC as protection against dollar inflation). However, this narrative competes with Bitcoin\\u2019s risk-asset behavior \\u2013 in practice, severe inflation that causes aggressive rate hikes can still hurt BTC in the short run (due to the risk-off effect). Traders should weigh whether the market is treating BTC more like \\u201ctech stocks\\u201d or \\u201cdigital gold\\u201d at any given time . Macro cues like real interest rates (inflation-adjusted yields) are informative: falling real yields (or negative real rates) tend to support hard assets including gold and Bitcoin, whereas sharply rising real yields (as the Fed fights inflation) can be a headwind.\\nRegulatory Tone & Institutional Flows: Being a nascent asset class, crypto is highly sensitive to regulatory developments. A supportive regulatory tone (for example, clear rules or approval of Bitcoin investment vehicles) can ignite multi-month uptrends, while crackdowns or bans have triggered sell-offs.

Unlike financial assets, oil is a physical commodity with usage patterns that ebb and flow throughout the year and across business cycles:\\n\\nGlobal Economic Growth (Demand Cycle): Oil demand is often referred to as the \\u201clifeblood of economic growth,\\u201d as virtually every sector (transportation, manufacturing, agriculture) relies on energy. Thus, the business cycle plays a major role in oil\\u2019s price cycle. During periods of robust global growth (rising GDP, industrial production, higher vehicle miles traveled), oil demand increases, often pushing prices up. Conversely, during recessions or slowdowns, oil demand can contract sharply as activity declines, leading to excess supply and price drops. Historical oil cycles illustrate this clearly: for example, in the 2003\\u20132007 expansion, global demand (especially from emerging markets like China) surged and oil entered a bull market, rising from ~$30 to nearly $150 per barrel by mid-2008. When the 2008 financial crisis hit, demand abruptly fell (global oil demand dropped year-over-year for one of the few times in decades) and oil collapsed over 70% from its peak, going from about $147 in July 2008 to under $40 by December 2008 . Similarly, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented demand crash \\u2013 with travel and industry halted, oil consumption plummeted. This led to a surreal event in April 2020 where WTI oil futures went negative (\\u2013$37/bbl) because storage filled up and no one wanted physical delivery . While that was a short-lived anomaly, it underscores how sensitive oil is to sudden demand shocks. Traders need to keep a pulse on the global economic outlook: indicators like PMI (Purchasing Managers\\u2019 Index), vehicle sales, airline traffic, etc., can foreshadow demand shifts. In a Macro Score, strong growth prospects (rising demand) = bullish (+1), while recession signals = bearish (\\u20131) for oil, generally speaking. Oil is often a leading indicator as well \\u2013 oil price spikes can themselves sow the seeds of recessions (by increasing costs), so there\\u2019s a reflexive cycle. For example, the sharp oil price rises in 1973 and 1979 contributed to stagflation and recessions in those periods , which then reduced demand and caused prices to pull back \\u2013 a boom/bust dynamic.\\nOPEC and Supply Management: On the supply side, OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and its allies (notably Russia, in the OPEC+ alliance) exert significant control over oil cycles. OPEC\\u2019s production quotas can tighten or flood the market. When OPEC coordinates to cut output, it often puts a floor under prices or sparks rallies; when they increase output or when members cheat quotas, it can lead to gluts.

Its price cycles are heavily influenced by factors like inflation, interest rates, and global risk sentiment, as well as well-defined seasonal demand patterns:\\n\\nInflation and Real Interest Rates: The inflation rate and, critically, real interest rates (interest rate minus inflation) form perhaps the most important macro fundamental for gold. Gold is traditionally seen as an inflation hedge and a store of value when paper money loses purchasing power. In practice, gold\\u2019s price tends to rise when real yields are falling or negative . There is a strong historical inverse correlation: one study found a correlation of about \\u20130.82 between gold prices and real 10-year Treasury yields . The reasoning is straightforward \\u2013 when real interest rates are low, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold is also low, making gold more attractive. Conversely, when real rates rise (e.g. higher bond yields outpacing inflation), gold often struggles because investors can get better real returns elsewhere . A classic example was the late 1970s: inflation was high and real interest rates were deeply negative at times, contributing to gold\\u2019s meteoric rise (gold hit record highs as inflation peaked around 1980). In contrast, the early 1980s saw the Federal Reserve hike rates aggressively above inflation (very high real rates), which ushered in a long bear phase for gold in the 1980s and 1990s. Traders analyzing gold\\u2019s macro cycle should watch metrics like CPI trends, central bank policy (rate hikes/cuts), and especially TIPS yields or 10-year real yield indicators. Falling real yields = bullish gold, while rising real yields (particularly if inflation is under control) often = bearish. In a Macro Confluence Score, one might assign a strong weight to the real interest rate trend (e.g. +2 if real rates are dropping or negative, \\u20132 if they are sharply rising). It\\u2019s often said that \\u201cinflation is gold\\u2019s best friend, and rate hikes its worst enemy.\\u201d This encapsulates the dynamic: unexpected inflation or currency debasement fears send investors to gold, whereas a hawkish Fed (raising rates) tends to dampen gold demand.\\nSafe-Haven Demand & Risk Sentiment: Gold also serves as a global safe-haven asset. In times of geopolitical crisis, financial stress, or equity market downturns, gold often catches a bid as investors seek stability. Examples include the 2008\\u20132009 financial crisis (gold initially dipped during the liquidity crunch but then surged as a safe haven as central banks responded), and the early 2020 pandemic shock (gold sold off in the very initial panic for liquidity, then rallied to new highs as the crisis unfolded and massive stimulus began). This \\u201crisk-off\\u201d demand means gold can move inversely to stocks in certain periods of fear.

Traders analyzing SPX must consider factors that affect corporate profits and investor risk appetite on multiple timeframes:\\n\\nEconomic Growth & Corporate Earnings Cycle: The stock market is forward-looking, often rising during economic expansions when corporate earnings are growing, and faltering when a recession looms (earnings decline). The business cycle (expansion -> peak -> recession -> trough -> expansion) is a cornerstone of equity pricing. During the early and mid-expansion phases, stocks tend to do well as revenues and profits climb. In late-cycle expansions, if growth overheats or inflation picks up, stocks can become choppier, anticipating a downturn. Once a recession hits, stocks usually enter a bear market (a decline >20%), often bottoming before the recession officially ends in anticipation of recovery. For instance, in the 2008\\u20132009 Global Financial Crisis, SPX peaked in late 2007 when the economy was still seemingly fine, then plunged throughout 2008 as the recession unfolded, bottoming in March 2009 even though the recession didn\\u2019t end until later that year. The subsequent expansion (2009-2019) saw a long bull market. Similarly, the 2020 COVID recession caused one of the fastest bear market drops (SPX fell ~34% in a month) followed by a steep recovery as stimulus and reopening drove a new expansion. Traders should watch economic indicators (GDP, unemployment, PMIs, consumer spending) as well as corporate earnings reports and guidance. If earnings are in an upswing (companies beating expectations, raising forecasts), that\\u2019s bullish for stocks. If earnings are contracting or many warnings are issued, it\\u2019s bearish. In a confluence score, one could incorporate an earnings trend factor (e.g. positive earnings revisions breadth = +1, negative revisions = \\u20131). Often, the stock market tops out about 6\\u20139 months before earnings peak and bottoms ~6 months before earnings trough \\u2013 this is the earnings cycle lead-lag. Recognizing those inflection points is key.\\nInterest Rates and Fed Policy: Monetary policy is a critical macro driver for SPX. Low interest rates reduce borrowing costs, boost corporate profits, and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds (the TINA \\u2013 \\u201cThere Is No Alternative\\u201d \\u2013 effect when yields are near zero). High rates do the opposite: they increase costs, can choke off growth, and provide competition for stocks (investors can get yield elsewhere). Thus, the Fed\\u2019s rate hike and cut cycles have a big impact. Historically, stock valuations (P/E ratios) tend to expand when rates are falling or low, and contract when rates are rising (particularly if inflation is high) .

TLT PRIORITY: Position Breakeven Analysis at 4.85% 20-Year Yield\n\nThe 20-year yield at 4.85% (DGS20, 2/19/2026) puts TLT approximately at $87-89.\nUsing TLT effective duration of ~17 years:\n\n| Position | Strike | Qty  | Approx Breakeven TLT | Required Yield Drop | Probability |\n|----------|--------|------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| $90C     | $90    | 650  | ~$93-95 at expiry    | ~55-85bps to 4.0%   | Moderate    |\n| $95C     | $95    | 300  | ~$98-100 at expiry   | ~85-105bps to 3.8%  | Low-Mod     |\n| $101C    | $101   | 3150 | ~$104-107 at expiry  | ~115bps to 3.7%     | Low         |\n| Shares   | -      | 1868 | At cost basis        | Any decline          | Moderate    |\n\nDuration math: 17yr \u00d7 0.85% yield drop = ~14.5% price increase \u2192 TLT $87 \u00d7 1.145 = ~$100.\nSo a move from 4.85% to 4.0% gets TLT to ~$100 \u2014 making $90C and $95C profitable, but\n$101C marginal. The $101C (3150 contracts) needs a recession-level catalyst.\n\nMacro signals this week:\n- Fed minutes: hawkish pause confirmed (bearish near-term for bonds)\n- Jan jobs: 130k (below 150k trend \u2014 mildly supportive)\n- 10-year: 4.1% (stable, not breaking lower)\n- RIKB auction data captured was ICELANDIC bonds (search error) \u2014 US data still needed\n- MOVE index level: NOT YET CAPTURED \u2014 critical gap\n\nTLT VERDICT: No immediate catalyst for the ~115bps rally $101C needs. The $90C position\nis more realistic. Watch: March FOMC (3/19), Q1 GDP, credit spread widening. Time decay\naccelerating \u2014 11 months to 1/15/27 expiry.\n\n### 2.

Captures decisions, mistakes, principles, and Matt's patterns so every conversation starts informed.\n\n## Matt's Core Values\n- Never ask questions with obvious answers \u2014 make the safe/obvious choice automatically\n- Anticipate 2 steps ahead. If something will be needed, build it now\n- One complete paste block per task. Never split. Never ask \"should I?\"\n- Operational requirements BEFORE features (permissions, monitoring, error handling, self-healing)\n- Longitudinal data over snapshots \u2014 show progression over time\n- Push shareworthy things to Telegram automatically. Never push routine status.\n- Be concise. Don't describe what you built \u2014 let output speak.\n- Matt is a strategist, not an engineer. Minimize cognitive load.\n- Never touch running processes. If pipeline is active, only modify dashboard/monitoring.\n- When presenting options, choose the safe default. Only ask if genuinely ambiguous.\n\n## What's Actually Deployed (verify via endpoints, don't trust static numbers)\n- Pipeline: ~/zeke-queue.sh (GATHER x6 \u2192 EXTRACT \u2192 ASSOCIATE, 900s timeout per job)\n- Reasoning: ~/zeke-reason.sh (Claude Code Opus, 9 tasks including self-heal + ops-status)\n- Dashboard: ~/zeke-dashboard-server.py port 3333, ~/zeke-dashboard.html, launchd plist\n- Status bridge: ~/zeke-status/build-status.py + history.jsonl, GitHub push every 10min\n- Cloudflare tunnel: running but EPHEMERAL \u2014 dies on reboot, URL changes. Needs launchd plist.\n- Crontab: 11pm queue, 7am reasoning, every 10min status push\n- 29 old Sonnet cron jobs still active \u2014 don't disable until 2 successful autonomous cycles\n- byProvider: spark/qwen3-32b-32k has 6 tools (exec, read, write, web_search, memory_search, web_fetch). Memory says remove write but verify actual openclaw.json before changing.\n- Claude Code permissions: ~/.claude/settings.json allows all, --dangerously-skip-permissions in headless scripts\n\n## Decision History (with rationale)\n- Local models limited to 6 tools \u2014 param mangling above ~6\n- Local models overwrite files \u2014 use exec with >> append only (write tool removal TBD verify)\n- delivery.mode \"none\" not \"announce\" \u2014 announce without targets causes system failures\n- 900s timeout up from 600s \u2014 treasury-bonds succeeds at 893s\n- Self-improvement prompt rewritten to specific terms after 6 consecutive dry runs\n- Timestamp TIMESTAMP literals replaced with natural language instruction in 12 job prompts\n- GitHub status bridge chosen over Gist \u2014 raw.githubusercontent.com has 3-5min CDN cache\n- Sequential pipeline, not parallel \u2014 Spark loads one model at a time efficiently\n- Hybrid arch: Spark ($0) GATHER/EXTRACT/ASSOCIATE, Claude Code CLI ($0 on Max sub) REASON/SELF-HEAL\n- KG uses SQLite + nomic-embed-text, 0.92 cosine similarity dedup threshold\n\n## Mistakes Made (principles extracted)\n- STATELESS: Claude Code has zero memory between sessions. Every prompt must read existing files first, "
