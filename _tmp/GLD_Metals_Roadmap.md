# GLD Options Roadmap — Two-Phase Metals Trade
### E*TRADE Taxable Account | Section 1256 (60/40 tax treatment)
### Total Capital: $40-50K | Date: Feb 24, 2026

## THE THESIS

**Phase 1 — Ride the current gold weekly cycle uptrend** (Now → ~May/June 2026)
Deploy ~$25-30K into shorter-dated GLD calls. Capture remaining weekly cycle upside.
Scale out as weekly cycle tops and broad market drawdown signals appear.

**Phase 2 — Reload after drawdown + Fed pivot** (~Mid-2026 → 2027+)
Deploy remaining ~$15-20K (plus Phase 1 profits) into deep Jan 2028 LEAPS.
Enter at potentially lower GLD prices, lower IV, with Fed easing as catalyst.

## CURRENT CYCLE POSITION (as of Feb 24, 2026)

| Cycle       | Timing Window   | Current Position        | Status             |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Daily       | 22-28 days      | Day ~19-21 (late cycle) | Approaching DCH     |
| Weekly      | 22-26 weeks     | Week ~7-8 (early)       | Bullish, room to run|
| Macro/8yr   | 8 years         | Mid-cycle secular bull  | All tailwinds aligned|

- **Weekly Cycle Low (WCL):** ~Jan 2-6 at GLD ~$393 (gold ~$4,331)
- **Weekly midpoint:** ~Week 11-13 (~late March / mid-April)
- **Weekly cycle high expected:** ~Week 18-22 (~May-June) if right-translating
- **Gold ATH:** $5,595 (Jan 29) → corrected to ~$4,750 → now recovering at ~$5,250
- **GLD current:** ~$473

## PHASE 1: THE CYCLE RIDE

### Capital Allocation: ~$25-30K

### Tranche 1 — TODAY (Feb 24)
**Deploy ~$12-15K immediately**

| Leg         | Strike | Expiry    | Rationale                                    |
|-------------|--------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Core        | $470C  | Sep 2026  | Slightly ITM. High delta (~0.55-0.60). Low theta burn with 7 months. Minimal erosion if gold chops. |
| Growth      | $500C  | Sep 2026  | ~5.7% OTM. More leverage. Pays off if gold runs through $5,500+ (GLD ~$500). |

**Split:** ~65% into $470C, ~35% into $500C

**Why Sep 2026:** 7 months gives time buffer through the entire weekly cycle + a margin of safety. You're planning to exit by May/June anyway, so September gives you ~3 months of cushion if timing stretches. Theta is still very manageable at this distance.

### Tranche 2 — Next Confirmed Daily Cycle Low (~1-7 trading days)
**Deploy ~$8-10K on confirmation**

Wait for the current daily cycle to complete and a new one to confirm. Confirmation signals (per Camel):
- Swing low pattern (lower low followed by higher low)
- Close above 10-day SMA after a pullback
- Trendline break above declining short-term trendline
- Oscillator reversal (RSI, MACD, or stochastic turning up from oversold)

**Same strikes as Tranche 1** (Sep 2026 $470C / $500C), but potentially at better prices if GLD dips into a daily cycle low.

### Tranche 3 (Optional) — Second Daily Cycle Low (~mid-March)
**Deploy remaining ~$5K if thesis is confirming**

Only if daily cycles are right-translating (bullish weekly confirmation). If you're seeing left-translated daily cycles or cycle failures, this is your warning — skip this tranche and preserve capital for Phase 2.

---

## PHASE 1 EXIT SIGNALS — When to Scale Out

### Watch for these weekly cycle topping signals (expected ~May/June):

**Early warnings (start scaling 25-50% out):**
- Daily cycle begins left-translating (top forms before midpoint)
- Daily cycle failure (price closes below prior daily cycle low)
- GLD approaches $520-540 (gold ~$5,700-5,900) — stretched move
- Weekly cycle reaches week 18+ and momentum divergences appear (RSI making lower highs while price makes higher highs)

**Strong exit signals (scale to 75-100% out):**
- Multiple consecutive left-translated daily cycles
- GLD breaks below prior daily cycle low on heavy volume
- Broad equity market showing signs of Camel's expected drawdown (SPX weekly cycle topping, credit spreads widening)
- Weekly cycle reaches week 22-26 timing window for WCL

**Hard stop:** If GLD breaks below $430 (gold ~$4,750) — this is the early Feb correction low. A break here means the weekly cycle has failed and the thesis is wrong for now.

## PHASE 2: THE RELOAD

### Capital: ~$15-20K dry powder + Phase 1 profits
### Trigger: Broad market drawdown confirmed + Fed pivot signals

### What You're Waiting For:
1. **Broad equity drawdown** plays out as Camel expects (mid/late 2026)
2. **Gold initially sells off in sympathy** (typical in liquidity events — March 2020 pattern)
3. **Fed responds** with rate cuts, QE, or emergency liquidity measures
4. **Gold/GLD forms a new weekly cycle low** with confirmation signals
5. **This becomes the entry** — lower prices, lower IV, biggest catalyst ahead

### Phase 2 Position Structure:

| Leg         | Strike | Expiry    | Allocation | Rationale                                   |
|-------------|--------|-----------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Core        | ITM by ~$20-30 | Jan 2028 | ~50-60%    | High delta, minimal theta. Ride the Fed printing wave. |
| Growth      | ATM or slightly OTM | Jan 2028 | ~25-30%    | Leverage to the recovery. Pays if gold runs to new ATHs. |
| Moonshot    | 10-15% OTM | Jan 2028  | ~10-15%    | Asymmetric bet on gold $6,000+ / GLD $540+   |

**Exact strikes TBD** — depends on where GLD is trading at the time. The framework stays the same: tiered strikes, most weight in ITM core, less in OTM moonshot.

### Phase 2 holds through 2027 commodity supercycle

## DECISION FRAMEWORK — Quick Reference

### Daily Cycle Checklist (every 22-28 trading days):
- [ ] Count days since last daily cycle low
- [ ] Is current daily cycle right-translating (top after midpoint)? → Bullish
- [ ] Is current daily cycle left-translating (top before midpoint)? → Caution
- [ ] Has a cycle failure occurred (close below prior DCL)? → Bearish warning
- [ ] Check confirmation signals at suspected lows before adding

### Weekly Cycle Health Check (ongoing):
- [ ] Are daily cycles within the weekly predominantly right-translating? → Weekly is bullish
- [ ] Are multiple daily cycles left-translating + failing? → Weekly is topping
- [ ] Has the weekly cycle passed its midpoint (~week 11-13)? → Second half, watch closer
- [ ] Is the weekly in the timing window for WCL (~week 22-26)? → Prepare for exit

### Broad Market Cross-Check:
- [ ] SPX showing weekly cycle topping signals?
- [ ] Credit spreads widening?
- [ ] VIX term structure inverting?
- [ ] Fed rhetoric shifting dovish in response to weakness?

## TAX NOTES

- All GLD options in E*TRADE taxable account qualify for Section 1256 treatment
- 60% taxed as long-term capital gains, 40% as short-term — regardless of holding period
- Saves ~$10,200 per $100K in gains vs. regular equity options at Matt's bracket
- No need to hold 12+ months — trade freely between Phase 1 and Phase 2
- Mark-to-market at year-end for any open 1256 positions (unrealized gains/losses reported)

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT

**Phase 1 max risk:** ~$25-30K deployed (total loss if options expire worthless — mitigated by Sep 2026 expiry giving 7 months and ITM core position)

**Phase 1 hard stop:** GLD breaks $430 → exit all, preserve capital for Phase 2

**Gap risk:** If drawdown doesn't come or is shallow, Phase 2 dry powder misses the move. Mitigation: Phase 1 still captures significant upside in current weekly cycle.

**Correlation risk:** Gold sells off hard in liquidity crunch before Fed responds. Mitigation: Phase 1 should already be closed before this. Phase 2 entry waits for confirmed WCL + Fed pivot.

**Timing risk:** Camel's drawdown call is wrong or delayed. Mitigation: Phase 2 capital stays in cash earning ~5% HYSA until conditions align. No forced entry.

---

## SUMMARY — WHAT TO DO TODAY

1. **Open E*TRADE options chain for GLD Sep 2026 expiry**
2. **Check bid-ask spreads** on $470C and $500C — want ≤3-5% of mid
3. **Deploy Tranche 1 (~$12-15K):**
   - ~$8-10K into GLD Sep 2026 $470 Calls
   - ~$4-5K into GLD Sep 2026 $500 Calls
4. **Set alerts** for GLD at $430 (hard stop), $500 (growth target), $520+ (stretch)
5. **Monitor daily cycle** — expect current DC to complete within ~1-7 days
6. **Prepare Tranche 2 capital** (~$8-10K) for next confirmed daily cycle low
7. **Keep ~$15-20K as dry powder** for Phase 2 reload
